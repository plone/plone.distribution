# Plone distribution support

## Overview

A Plone distribution is a pre-packaged version of Plone that includes specific features, themes, modules, and configurations.
It is a convenient way to get a specific type of website up and running quickly, as the distribution includes everything needed to run that type of site.

## Prior art
Examples of Plone distributions (created without this package) include:

* [SENAITE](https://www.senaite.com)
* [Quaive](https://quaivecloud.com/)
* [Portal Modelo](https://www.interlegis.leg.br/produtos-servicos/portal-modelo/)
* [Portal Padr√£o](https://identidade-digital-de-governo-plone.readthedocs.io/en/latest/)

## Similar Concept in Other CMS

* Drupal: Drupal has distributions for blogs, e-commerce sites, and intranet portals.
* WordPress: WordPress has a similar concept in the form of "WordPress Multisite," which allows users to run multiple websites from a single installation of WordPress.
* Joomla: Joomla has a similar concept in the form of "Joomla Templates," which are pre-designed templates for Joomla websites.
* TYPO3: TYPO3 has a similar concept in the form of "TYPO3 Distributions," which are pre-configured installations of TYPO3 for specific types of websites.
